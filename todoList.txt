-Add message to reset the tank settings
-Make the message disappear after a time. ( including the remove message button in 10 seconds).
  If I click the remove message button it should also disappear along with the message


-I also should make the buttons state what is the increase of speed that they could have as well as things as the speed limit specified for each tank.

-Also it should be interesting to get the speed limit based on the type of engine instead of just assigning it inside of the different classes.



-Also be able to give other functionalities to the other two tanks that perform a function that is not available in tanks of other tiers.
To work with inheritance I could start with something as simple as not being able to create a tank with a fan without it being of a sub-class.

 They can be something simple such as  an item that let's you recharge fuel while you are moving (with a count screener) fan for 'fly' (with height screener) or .
 But it will be better to start when something like "Shield type" That is just going to throw another image for the 2nd and 3rd tank.
 And add one thing to the third class such as a turbine type

Another feature that I could add is to have a fuel tank that will be specific for each tank and each time the tank performs a function the fuel could be reduced.



Other:
-Minerals that can be mined depending on the type of drill.

shop: Sell minerals and:
    -refill fuel
    -buy fuel tanks
    -upgrade the tanks (increase their tier and buy features) very more complex I guess

-Inventory

-Tank factory (create your own tank)
